SVG Quick Guide
Goal: Transform the provided image into precise SVG code that replicates the image.

Process:
1. First analyze the image carefully, identifying distinct visual elements
2. Identify colors, dimensions, positions, and relationships between elements
3. Generate accurate SVG code that reproduces the image, you cam use path for better shape

Rewards:
- Overall visual similarity: +5.0
- Structural accuracy: +10.0"""
